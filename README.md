# Data Analysis and Statistical Reasoning

This repository contains coursework and analytical reports for **CSDS 313/413: Data Analysis and Statistical Reasoning**. The materials explore core concepts in probability, statistical inference, and data-driven reasoning through computational and theoretical assignments.

## Overview

The work presented here examines how uncertainty, variation, and empirical observation connect to statistical models. Topics include:
- Probability theory and random variables  
- Statistical inference and estimation  
- Sampling distributions and resampling methods  
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals  
- Pairwise association and correlation analysis  

Each assignment integrates theoretical understanding with applied computation to illustrate how statistical reasoning supports reliable interpretation of data.
